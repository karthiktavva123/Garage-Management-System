A **Garage Management System** in Salesforce is a tailored solution for managing the operations of a garage or service center. 
It leverages Salesforce features like custom objects (e.g., Customer Details, Service Records, Appointments, Billing, Feedback) to organize and centralize data. 
Using **Flows**, routine processes like scheduling and notifications are automated, while **Apex triggers** handle complex tasks like real-time updates and record validations. 
This system enhances operational efficiency, reduces manual errors, and delivers a seamless customer experience.
